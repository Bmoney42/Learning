Each step must follow logically from previous ones using valid rules of inference (the “agreed-upon rules” part).
A proof Of A Formal Explaination Of Why Something Is True.

Discrete Is The Finite Point While Continous Is Any Number Of Points. 
**Examples: ** Discrete(counting) vs Contious (Measuring)
- 1 vs 1.01 
- Int Vs Float/Double 
- Pepperoni Vs Grated Cheese. 
- Stair Steps Vs Escalator 

Mathematics is the study of abstract structures and their properties, and the logical consequences of those properties.
Form And Matter Go Together..

**Formal is the expression of Symbols. **

A ∩ B ⊆ A

**HELP FROM CHATPGT** + My Own Notes

Perfect — you’re describing one of the most beautifully consistent rules in set theory.

Let’s restate what you said:

“If I have sets A and B, then the intersection of A and B is always a subset of the union of A and B.”

In math symbols, that’s:

A ∩ B ⊆ A

A ∩ B Means all elements that are in both A and B.
A ∪ B all elements that are in A or in B (or both). 

A ⊆ B means: all element A = B 
set → set
{1,2} ⊆ {1,2,3}
all elements of {1,2} are in {1,2,3}

“∈” (Element of)This is about membership — individual elements inside a set.
element → set
2 ∈ {1,2,3}
2 is in the set


**Another Example:**
X ( If x is True) 
X => Y ( Whenever X happens, Y must also happen.) 
Y ( The Y Is The Case) 
So 𝑋 ⇒ 𝑌
X⇒Y doesn’t say whether X or Y are true — it just describes a relationship between them:
“If the first is true, the second must follow.”
This is a logical rule called Modus Ponens.

**Chapter 2:** -- **Sets & Tuples** 
  
  Talking About A Certain "Group Or Collection" Of Things But Not These Other Things. 
 **Sets** A = { 2, 3 }
Doesn't  have a order, can be 3,2 or even 2,3. doesn't Matter.
They Do Not Have Duplicates Each Set Is Unique. 
it's hetergenous Or Can Be Compose Of Multiple Different Things. 

**Truples** = Order Pair 

B = (2,3)  ( b for banana symbol) 
think of graphing a line on a graph, 2,3 =! 3,2 on a graph, so it doesn't make sense
