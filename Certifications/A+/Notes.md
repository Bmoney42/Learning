SO-DIMM = Small Outline Dual In-Line Memory Module - Used In Laptops And Mobile Devices
Some Laptops Have Soldered To The System Board - Requires Full Replacement 

Magnetic Disk Are Old And Outdatd
Newer Versions- 
**SSD ( Solid State Drive)**
- All Memory No Moving Parts
- Silent Fast Access Time, Less Latency

Note: **M2 Is Smaller Form Factor** - Chip Vs Drive  
No SATA Data or Power - Easy To Install And Replace.

Can Move The Data FROM HDD To SSD By Cloning Or Imaging The The HDD

Hotspot Vs Tethering 
- Hotspot - Multiple Devices
- Tethering - 1 Device 

Wired Devices: 
USB Connection Are Common On Laptaps
3.5mm or TRRS ( Tip Ring Ring Sleeve) Analog Plug (Old School)

Wireless Networks 
3G - Introduced In 1988
Upgraded Data Connectivity 
- Allowed For GPS, Mobile televison, Video Conferencing 
4g
- LTE Long Term Evolution
Based On GSM ( Global System For Mobile Communication )
EDGE ( Enhanced Data Rates For GSM Evolution)
Supports Rates Fo 150MB+
- LTE - A Advanced 
Supports 300mbit/sec +

5g - 2020 
Higher Frequency 
10gb/sec 
Start Of The IOT 
- Bandwith Isnt A Constraint
- Larger Data Transfers

SIM - Subcriber Idenity Module  
- Tracks ID and Number
- Cellular Network
- Can Store Contacts and Messages

Esims Are Not Physical Can Be Transfered With QR Code Or Data Transfer

MDM - Mobile Device Manager
- Can Control the Device, Functions, Security, Data, And Other Functions
   - BOYD - Bring Your Own Device
   - COPE - Corporate Owned, Personally Enabled
   - CYOD - Choose Your Own Device
- Can Contrl Email Config
- Enable 2 Factor Auth

MultiPlexing Refers To Using Many Different Applications At The Same Time. 
- TCP And UDP

Connection-Orientated Protocols - Prefers Return Receipt 
- TCP = Transmission Control Protocol ( Connection Orientated, Formal Set Up And Close)
   - Reliable Delivery ( recover from errors)
   - Flow Control ( how much data is sent)
- HTTPS - Hyper Transfer Protocol Secure) 
- SSH ( Secure Shell ) 

**Connectionless Protocol**
   
- UDP  = User Datagram Protocol ( Real-Time Communication) 
   - UNreliable Delivery ( No Error Recovery )
   - No Flow Control
  - DHCP ( Dynamic Host Config Protocol 
  - TFTP ( Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
     - Application Keeps Track Of The Data and Devices What To Do 

Ports can be between 0 and 65,535
- Well Known Port Numbers To Connect With A Well Known Service.

TCP Port 80 Is Not The Same As UDP Port 80
Common Ports:
TCP/20/FTP ( Active mode data) 
TCP/21/FTP ( Control) 
- File Transfer between Systems
- Authoication Or Anonymous login
- Full Feature Functionablity
   - Add, List, Delete, etc

TCP/22/SSH 
  - Looks And Acts Like Telnet
TCP/23/Telnet  Telecommunication Network
  - No Encription All In The Clear

TCP/25/ Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
  - Server To Server Email
  - To Receive And Send We Use (IMAP, Pop3)

DNS - Domain Name Service 
Transfers IP's Into Names 
  UDP/53 

DHCP  - Dynamic Host Config Protol 
Automated Config Of IP Addresses, Subnet Mask, And Other Options 
UDP/67 UDP/68
  
 
Routers: Layer 3 Switches
 - Routes traffic between subnets
 - connects LAN, WAN, Fiber, Copper

Switch : 
   - Bridges done in hardware
   - ACIS ( Application specific integrated circuit)
   - fowards traffic based on data link address (MAC ADDRESS)
   - POE - Power Over Ethernet (power devices then themselves)

   unmanaged Switched
      - Plug and Play
      - Fixed Config  / No VLan
      - Very Little intregration with other devices
      - no logs
      - Cheaper
   
   managed switched
      - Vlan Support
      - Traffic prioritization 
      - redunancy support
      - port mirroring (monitoring port)

   Access point: ( not a wireless router)
    - Takes A wired device and makes it wireless
    - a wireless router is both a router and an access point ( Extends the wired network onto a wireless network) 
    - bridges communication - makes decision based on MAC address
    
   Patch Panel Allows for connectiviity to another switch or Vlan without moving the extended connection from the desk to the closet.

   Firewall - 
    - OSI Layer 4 TCP/UDP 
    - Some Firewalls can filter by application - Next Gen Firewalls
    - Can Encrypt in/out of the network (Protect traffic)
    - Can Act As Proxy 
    - Most Firewalls Can be Layer 3 Devices (Routers)

Power Over Ethernet ( POE )
   - Smart Cameras (Ring)
   - Nests
   - Google Wifi
   - Access Points
        - Built In Power - Endspan
        - in-line / adapter - midspan
    -POE - 15.4 watt DC 350 mA
    -POE+ - 25.5 Watt DC 600 mA 
    -POE++ - 51 Watt Type 3 600 mA
             71.3 Watt Type 4 960 mA
          - POE With 10GBBASE-T
         
   Broadband - Cable Modem 1Gb+ Speed
    - Transmission From Different Freq 
    - Data on The "Cable" Network DOCSIS Data Over Cable Service Interface Spec.
